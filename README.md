# NgrxCrudPoc

This project is a proof of concept for creating a ngrx utility library with factories for actions, reducers, selectors 
and facade which simplify working with common crud operation for a given resource.

The utility library is called **ngrx-crud-util** (in the libs folder). 
The root application is a simple example; to try it run: 
```
npm run start-both
```
